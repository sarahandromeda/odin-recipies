    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lentil Dal is an Indian style dish that is usually made vegetarian or vegan. Dal can be made with any kind of lentils and tweaked to give a variety of flavor profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe is for a dal made from Red Lentils which are shelled green lentils. During cooking, some of the lentils will smash to give the dish a thick porridge-like consistency. The cost of most of the needed ingredients is relatively low making this a great less-expensive but very filling option.
